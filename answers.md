## How do they answer "Where are you from?"
     - two of them have an preset answer; of "from your computer", but I was originated in _____.
     - the two chatbots that answer that, also can answer "Woher kommst du" (Where are you), but not "D'ou viens tu"(Where are you)
     - A.L.I.C.E gave an answer in English. With only one German word, Aus (from). While with Mitsuki, she said "Aus leeds" (from leeds)l making 
      - a very simple german sentance. 
      - The other one, Madam Zena, has randomized answers that generally mean similar things. 
      - I thought it was peculiar that 2 of them answered to "Where are you from" in German, and not French moreso than the response. 
      - It was more clever than interesting for me that, two of them had the answer "I was origionated in"
## How do they answer to "abcdefg"
    - Mitsuki is the only one that recognized it was part of the alphabet. 
    - A.L.I.C.E & Zena had a response along the line with "idk"

## What's interesting or peculiar. 
    (some parts of this were answered in where they are from, but I wanted to generalize this. I was confused on the scope of it)
    - I think Zena is interesting, she has the most lore and personality.
